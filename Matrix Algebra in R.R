# Matrix Algebra Example


#############################################


# I. The Goal

# Linear Algebra is the basic foundation for machine learning and statistical models.
# We focus on linear algebra using R with emphases on matrices and arrays. 


# II. Matrices

# Concatenating vectors can be done by using rbind() and cbind() functions.
# Creating matrices requires the matrix() function, and of course is.matrix() and as.matrix() can be used similarly for their respective purposes.

# III. Arrays
